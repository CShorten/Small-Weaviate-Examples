We import the necessary classes from the transformers package. This includes AutoTokenizer and AutoModel for tokenizing and processing customer review text.\n2. We use the from_pretrained method of the AutoModel class to load the pre-trained model 'YituTech/conv-bert-base'. This model is based on ConvBERT and is suitable for feature extraction in text data.\n3. We load the customer review text, tokenize it, and use the model to extract features from the review. These features can then be used to analyze customer sentiment.\n<<<code>>>: from transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModel\ntokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained('YituTech/conv-bert-base')\nmodel = AutoModel.from_pretrained('YituTech/conv-bert-base')\ninputs = tokenizer(customer_review, return_tensors='pt')\nfeatures = model(**inputs)\n",
